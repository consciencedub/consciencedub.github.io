I first jumped into website design and development when I built mountainbikepittsburgh.com in 2004. I used Dreamweaver and Fireworks to make it happen. 
## I am a creative director with these skills:
    * Visual design
    * User Experience Design
    * Human Centered Design

I went deep into product design while launching the SaaS app [Forever](http://Forever.com), a place to store your memories forever.
I'm now a Digital Creative Director creating fundraising campaigns for non-profits.
I create campaigns using Axure for planning and prototyping, and Sketch, After Effects and Photoshop for visual design.

You can view some of my [portfolio](http://farrarsteve.com) here. I built it using [Semplice](http://semplicelabs.com).
